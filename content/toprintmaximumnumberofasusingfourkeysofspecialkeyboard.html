<h1>To print maximum number of As using four keys of special keyboard.</h1>

Let us assume that we have a specially made keyboard which has following four keys:<br>
Key 1:  This key prints character 'A' on the output screen<br>
Key 2: (Ctrl-A): This keys selects the complete contents of the screen - same function as (Ctrl + A) of PC<br>
Key 3: (Ctrl-C): This key copies the seleceted content to buffer or clipboard - same function as (Ctrl + C) of PC<br>
Key 4: (Ctrl-V): This key appends saved contents of buffer/clipboard to the output screen. <br>
If you are allowed to press keys of this special keyboard N times, write a program which calculates maximum numbers of As possible.<br>
<br>
Example -   <br>
Input:  N = 3<br>
Output: 3  <br>
Maximum number of As possible with 3 keystrokes is 3 which are obtained by using following key sequence - 
A, A, A   
<br><br>
Input:  N = 8  <br>
Output: 12 <br>
Maximum number of As possible with 8 keystrokes is 9 which are obtained by using  following key sequence -
A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
OR following keysequence also produces 12 As
A, A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
<br><br>
Input:  N = 12<br>
Output: 36<br>
Maximum number of As possible with 12 keystrokes is 36 which are obtained by using following key sequence -  
A, A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
<br><br>

<b>Algorithm/Insights</b>
<br><br>
If number of allowed keystrokes(N) is less than 7, then the maximum number of As possible is N. You should be able to verify this yourself. <br><br>

It turns out that for N greater than or equal to 7, to produce maximum number of As, the sequence of N keystrokes that will be used will always end with a suffix of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, followed by all Ctrl-V's. We have to basically figure out the point(say critical-point) after which we should use this suffix of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, followed by all Ctrl-V's to obtain maximum number of As.<br><br>

To find out this critical point for input N, we try out each of the values from N-3 to 1 and compute the number of As that are produced after making a value as critical point and then appending it with the suffix of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, followed by all Ctrl-V's. While computing maximum number of As possible with each trial critical point(from N-3 to 1) plus above suffix of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, followed by all Ctrl-V's, we use maximum number of As already computed for each value(N-3 to 1).<br><br>

Say f(N) denotes the maximum number of As possible for N keystrokes. Let use see how do we compute f(N) for N = 7.  <br><br>

First we choose critical point 'N_critical' as 4. We already know the value of f(4) which is 4. For remaining 3 keystrokes, we use Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V. The string of keystrokes produced will be A,A,A,A,Ctrl-A,Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V. These last 3 keystrokes essentially double the value of f(4). Hence for 'N_critical = 4', we get 8 number of As which is 2*f(4).<br><br>

Now we choose critical point 'N_critical' as 3. We already know the value of f(3) which is 3. For remaining 4 keystrokes, we use Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-V. The string of keystrokes produced will be A,A,A,Ctrl-A,Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-V. These last 4 keystrokes essentially triple the value of f(3). Hence for 'N_critical = 3', we get 9 number of As which is 3*f(3).<br><br>

Similarly, for 'N_critical' = 2, we get 4*f(2) number of As which is 8. And for 'N_critical' = 1, maximum number of As possible is 5*f(1) which is 5. <br><br>

Therefore choosing 'N_critical' as 3 gives us maximum number of As. In other words, f(7) = 9. <br><br>

In general,<br>
f(N) = N if N < 7
     = max{2*f(N-3), 3*f(N-4),..., (N-2)*f(1)}<br>

The algorithm basically needs to implement the above recurrence relation where base case is defined as f(N) = N when N < 7. To avoid re-computations of same sub-problems, intermediate results are stored in an array and re-used if required. Please check out function findMaxAs(int n, int[] maxAsSolution) in code snippet for implementation details.<br><br>
