<h1>Gnome Sort</h1>

<p>The simplest sort algorithm is not Bubble Sort..., it is not Insertion Sort..., it's Gnome Sort!

Gnome sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to Insertion sort, except that moving an element to its proper place is accomplished by a series of swaps, as in Bubble Sort.

Gnome Sort is based on the technique used by the standard Dutch Garden Gnome (Du.: tuinkabouter). Here is how a garden gnome sorts a line of flower pots. Basically, he looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous one; if they are in the right order he steps one pot forward, otherwise he swaps them and steps one pot backwards. Boundary conditions: if there is no previous pot, he steps forwards; if there is no pot next to him, he is done.
</p>
<pre> void gnomesort(int n, int ar[]) {
	int i = 0;
	
	while (i < n) {
		if (i == 0 || ar[i-1] <= ar[i]) i++;
		else {int tmp = ar[i]; ar[i] = ar[i-1]; ar[--i] = tmp;}
	}
}
</pre>

The pseudocode for the algorithm is:
<pre>
function gnomeSort(a[0..size-1])
    i := 1
    j := 2
    while i < size do
        if a[i-1] <= a[i] then
            // for descending sort, use >= for comparison
            i := j
            j := j + 1 
        else
            swap a[i-1] and a[i]
            i := i - 1
            if i = 0 then
                i := j
                j := j + 1
            endif
        endif
    done


This algorithm sorts in place modifying the passed array (of n integer numbers).

void gnome_sort(int *a, int n)
{
  int i=1, j=2, t;
# define swap(i, j) { t = a[i]; a[i] = a[j]; a[j] = t; } 
  while(i < n) {
    if (a[i - 1] > a[i]) {
      swap(i - 1, i);
      if (--i) continue;
    }
    i = j++;
  }
# undef swap
}
