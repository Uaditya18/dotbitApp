<h1>Find Buy/Sell Prices in Array of Stock Values to Maximize Profit</h1>

<b>Problem:</b><br><br> You have given a stock prices for next 10 days. Find out: max benefit in best time complexity in buy and sell 1 share ?<br><br>
Condition: Share must be sold any day after buying date.<br>

For ex:<br>
<pre>
Share price in thousands
5 1 4 6 7 8 4 3 7 9
Max benefit 9 â€“ 1 = 8 thousand
</pre><br>
<b>Solution:</b>
<br><br>
The max benefit is the case where you buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest, with the condition that the buy has to be before sell.
<br><pre>
public static int getMaxBenefit(int []S)
{
 int maxBenefit = 0;
 int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
 for (int i = 0; i < S.length; i++)
 {
 maxBenefit = Math.max(maxBenefit, S[i] - minPrice);
 minPrice = Math.min(S[i], minPrice);
 }
 
 return maxBenefit;
}
</pre>
Time Complexity: O(N)
