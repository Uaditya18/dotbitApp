<h1>Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm</h1>

Given a graph with no negative distance between any two nodes, find the shortest distance between initial node '0' and all nodes. For example, for the following graph<br><br>
<img src="dijkstra_0.gif" alt="dijkstra_0" />
Shortest distance of node '0' from node '0' is 0<br><br>
Shortest distance of node '1' from node '0' is 2<br><br>
Shortest distance of node '2' from node '0' is 1<br><br>
Shortest distance of node '3' from node '0' is 6<br><br>
Shortest distance of node '5' from node '0' is 12<br><br>
Shortest distance of node '6' from node '0' is 12<br><br>
and node '4' is unreachable from node '0'
<br><br>
<b>Algorithm/Insights</b>
<br><br>
Dijkstra's algorithm essentially uses breadth first search with greedy approach to come up with the shortest distance between given two nodes.<br><br>
Let the node from which we would find the shortest distance of all other nodes be called initial node. We define the distance of node 'Y' as the distance from the initial node to node 'Y'. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step. The steps of the algorithm are as following
<br><br>
1. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. 
This step signifies that at the start of the algorithm, the starting node is at distance 0 from itself and other nodes are unreachable.
<br><br>
2. Set the initial node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
<br><br>
3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B (through A) will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Also change the parent node of this neighbor as the current node. These parent nodes will help to backtrack the shortest path to a node from the source node. If the currently assigned distance value of the neighbor node is smaller than distance of neighbor from current node + current node's assigned distance then don't do anything.
<br><br>
4. When we are done considering all the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
<br><br>
5. If there is no node remaining in unvisited set or the smallest distance of node in unvisited set is infinity then stop. Algorithm is completed. 
<br><br>
6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.
<br><br>
This algorithm is implemented using priority queue for keeping node with the shortest distance from the source at the front of the queue(remember greedy approach), parent array for keeping track of immediate parent of a node on the shortest path from source to that node, distance array to keep track of shortest distance of a node from source node, unvisted array. Let's see how it works for the graph shown here.<br><br>
<img src="dijkstra_0.gif" alt="dijkstra_0" />	

1. To start with, all the nodes are unvisited, distance of all nodes from source node '0' is infinity and parent of all nodes is invalid/-1.<br><br>

2. Now we add source node '0' to the queue with distance as 0.<br><br>
<img src="dijkstra_1.gif" alt="dijkstra_1" />

3. We remove node 0 from queue, mark it as visited, make distance[0] as 0. Parent[0] still remains -1 since this is the starting vertex. We add neighbors of node 0 that is node 1 and node 2 to the queue, updated their parent to node 0, and update their distance entries as well. <br><br>
<img src="dijkstra_2.gif" alt="dijkstra_2" />

4. Now we remove node 2 from queue which would be at the front of the queue since it has the least distance of all nodes in the queue, mark this node as visited. We then add all the unvisited neighbors of node 2 (node 3 and node 6) to the queue if they are not already in the queue. Then for each unvisited neighbor of node 2 we check if the assigned distance of that neighbor is greater than assigned distance of node 2 + distance between node 2 and that neighbor. If this is the case then we update parent of that neighbor to node 2 and  update assigned distance of that neighbor to distance of node 2 + distance between node 2 and that neighbor.<br><br>
<img src="dijkstra_3.gif" alt="dijkstra_3" />

We repeat above step for all entries in the queue until the queue is not empty. As the algorithm progresses, the states of relevant data structures are shown below. At the end of the algorithm, each distance[i] specifies the shortest distance of node 'i' from node 0.<br><br>
