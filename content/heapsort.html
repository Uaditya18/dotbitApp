<h1>Heap Sort</h1>
<p>Heap is a special case of balanced binary tree data structure where root-node key is compared with its children and arranged accordingly. If &alpha; has child node &beta; then &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">key(&alpha;) &ge; key(&beta;)</p>
<p>As the value of parent is greater than that of child, this property generates <b>Max Heap</b>. Based on this criteria a heap can be of two types &minus;</p>

<p>Both trees are constructed using the same input and order of arrival.</p>
<h2>Max Heap Construction Algorithm</h2>
<p>We shall use the same example to demonstrate how a Max Heap is created. The procedure to create Min Heap is similar but we go for min values instead of max ones.</p>
<p>We are going to derive an algorithm for max-heap by inserting one element at a time. At any point of time, heap must maintain its property. While insertion, we also assume that we are inserting a node in already heapified tree.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1 &minus;</b> Create a new node at the end of heap.
<b>Step 2 &minus;</b> Assign new value to the node.
<b>Step 3 &minus;</b> Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
<b>Step 4 &minus;</b> If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
<b>Step 5 &minus;</b> Repeat step 3 &amp; 4 until Heap property holds.
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In Min Heap construction algorithm we expect the value of parent node to be less than that of child node.</p>
<p>Let's understand Max Heap construction by an animated illustration. We take the same input sample that we use earlier.</p>

<h2>Max Heap Deletion Algorithm</h2>
<p>Lets derive an algorithm to delete from max-heap. Deletion in Max (or Min) Heap is always happen at the root to remove the Maximum (or minimum) value.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<b>Step 1 &minus;</b> Remove root node.
<b>Step 2 &minus;</b> Move the last element of last level to root.
<b>Step 3 &minus;</b> Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
<b>Step 4 &minus;</b> If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
<b>Step 5 &minus;</b> Repeat step 3 &amp; 4 until Heap property holds.
