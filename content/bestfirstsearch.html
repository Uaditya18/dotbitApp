<h1>Best first search</h1>
<p>
Best-first search is an algorithm that traverses a graph in search of one or more goal nodes. As we will discover in a few weeks, a maze is a special instance of the mathematical object known as a "graph". In the meantime, however, we will use "maze" and "graph" interchangeably.

The defining characteristic of this search is that, unlike DFS or BFS (which blindly examines/expands a cell without knowing anything about it or its properties), best-first search uses an evalutation function (sometimes called a "heuristic") to determine which object is the most promising, and then examines this object. This "best first" behaviour is implemented with a PriorityQueue.</p>

The algorithm for best-first search is thus:
<pre>
Best-First-Search( Maze m )
    Insert( m.StartNode )
    Until PriorityQueue is empty
        c <- PriorityQueue.DeleteMin
        If c is the goal
            Exit
        Else
            Foreach neighbor n of c
                If n "Unvisited"
                    Mark n "Visited"                    
                    Insert( n )
            Mark c "Examined"                    
End procedure

</pre>
