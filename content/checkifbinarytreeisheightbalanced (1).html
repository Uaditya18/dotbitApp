<h1>Check if Binary Tree is Height Balanced?</h1>

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.<br><br>
<b>Solution</b>
<br><br>
A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.<br><br>
The solution presented is a recursive. Find the height of left and right subtrees and check the difference of the heights. If the difference is more than 1 the tree is not balanced. The tree is balanced if the difference is zero or one.
<br><br>
<b>Implementation:</b>
<br><br>

public class CheckBinaryTreeHeightBalanced {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        int left,right;
        if(root ==null){ return true;}
        left = getHeight(root.left);
        right =getHeight(root.right);
 
        return (Math.abs(left-right)<=1 && isBalanced(root.left) && isBalanced(root.right));
 
    }
 
    public int getHeight(TreeNode root){
        if(root ==null) return 0;
        int left = getHeight(root.left);
        int right = getHeight(root.right);
 
        return 1+ (left>right?left:right);
    }
