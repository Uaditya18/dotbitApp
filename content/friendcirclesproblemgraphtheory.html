<h1>Friend Circles Problem - Graph Theory</h1>

There are n students in a class. Every student can have 0 or more friends. If A is a friend of B and B is a friend of C then A and C are also friends. So we define a friend circle as a group of students who are friends as given by above definition. Given an nXn-matrix friends which consists of characters Y or N. If friends[i][j]=Y, then ith and jth students are friends, friends[i][j]=N, then i and j are not friends. Find the total number of such friend circles in the class.
<br><br>
<b>Algorithm/Insights</b>
<br><br>
1. We start with the first student (first row), i = 0. set visited[i] = Y<br><br>
2. Initialize noOfCircles = 1<br><br>
3. Move to next student j, for which M[i][j] == Y, set visited[j] = Y.<br><br>
4. Recursively, find friends of j and mark them visited too till all students that can be reached from i=0 are covered. These will form 1 friend circle.<br><br>
5. Once all friends of student 1 are traversed, we move to next unvisited student and increase noOfCircles by 1.<br><br>
6. Repeat the above steps till all the students are visited.<br><br>
7. Return noOfCircles.<br><br>

public class FriendCirclesGraph {

        char[][] friends = {"YYNN".toCharArray(), "YYYN".toCharArray(), "NYYN".toCharArray(), "NNNY".toCharArray()};
        System.out.println(getFriendCircles(friends));
    }
 
    public static int getFriendCircles(char[][] friends) {
 
        if (friends == null || friends.length < 1)
            return 0;
 
        int noOfCircles = 0;
 
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[friends.length];
 
        for (int i = 0; i < visited.length; i++)
            visited[i] = false;
 
        for (int i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                noOfCircles++;
                visited[i] = true;
                findFriends(friends, visited, i);
            }

        for (int i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {

                visited[i] = true;
